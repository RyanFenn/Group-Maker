# Group-Maker
- An application for creating random groups for sports.
- Brief instructions: select the players that will be attending the event, adjust settings, and then click "Create Groups".
- After groups are generated, players can be manually swapped in the group display window.
- There is a button in the group display window that copies the current list of groups to the computers clipboard. From here, the list can be pasted into a message, text file, etc.
